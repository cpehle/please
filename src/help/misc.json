        "plzconfig": "The root of a Please repo is identified by a .plzconfig file. This also has a number of options to control various ways it behaves.\n\nSee https://please.build/config.html for a detailed reference of all options.\n\nThere are several different .plzconfig files that can be loaded, which override one another. From lowest to highest priority:\n .plzconfig, which identifies the repo root.\n .plzconfig_linux_amd64 (or _darwin_amd64, etc) defines arch-specific options.\n /etc/plzconfig can be used to define machine-specific options (e.g. on a CI server)\n .plzconfig.local is used for non-checked-in config that is bespoke to the user.",
	"tracing": "Please can generate output compatible with Chrome's built-in tracing tool. It can be switched on with the --trace_file flag and, once done, you can load the file by visiting chrome://tracing.\nThis is a handy way to visualise where time is spent during a build and can be useful to diagnose slow builds.",
	"please_test_worker": "Please supports submitting tests to remote worker processes to run. The protocol that these processes observe is defined in the Please repository, and we ship with a reference implementation named please_test_worker.\n\nFor most smaller repos, the normal local test strategy works fine, but for large repos with many heavy tests, this is a way of distributing the load.\n\nThis functionality is still somewhat experimental."
